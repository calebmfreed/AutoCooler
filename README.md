Autonomous Prime
================

This is the mobile app that communicates via bluetooth to the RC car.

The car is outfitted with a serial bluetooth reciever, gps module, and arduino to control the cars movements.

The app can be used by following the onscreen instructions. Basically the buttons on the bottom toolbar need to pressed in order from left to right.

	The first button (magnifying glass) connects the phone to the arduino. Must have bluetooth enabled for this step.

	Second button will tell the car to send its current gps location and then plot it on the map.

	The user then needs to press and hold the location he/she wishes the car to travel. The route will be mapped, and additional points can be added by long pressing. The points then need to be arranged in the correct order on the tableview page.

	The third button sends the coordinates to the car to begin navigation.

	The fourth button cancels the operations.
